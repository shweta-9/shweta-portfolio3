				<p class="hidden">Earthwatch is a mobile app that allows users to monitor their weekly consumption. This is designed for energy-conscious users age 12 and up who are looking to improve their carbon footprint. Earthwatch is an all-in-one package that can track five contributors to greenhouse gases; electricity, heating, transportation, meat consumption, and air travel. The app gives users visibility on the duration each device has been on for, the amount of carbon dioxide it releases, and the ability to wirelessly switch it on/off through the app itself.
